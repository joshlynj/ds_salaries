## üéâ Full Time Data Science Salaries From U.S. Companies between 2022-2023
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data using various scientific methods, algorithms, and tools. It combines elements of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data sets.


## üíº Stakeholder Interest
Wage information allows for those in search of a job to know what to expect from an employer.   
Understanding the threshold for fair compensation is super important. It allows employees to know what is a fair wage for certain positions and skill levels. 
This information can ensure they are being fairly compensated for their skills, experience, and contributions.    
This data can help individuals make informed decisions about career paths, job changes, and skill development to maximize their earning potential.    
Additionally, access to salary information promotes transparency within organizations and across industries. 

## üéá Summary
The questions answered are:
- What are the highest paid jobs in the data science field?
- What are the lowest paid jobs?

## üó∫ Remote work ratio based on company size

To give some background on this dataset:
  In terms of company sizes, small company is defined as a company with 500 employees or less
  Medium Company is defined as companies with 500-1000 employees.
  Large companies is defined as companies with 1000+ employees. 

Each graph shows the remote ratio by company size and split up into 3 categories: 
- In person only which is 0%
- Hybrid which is 50%
- Fully remote jobs which is 100%

Small companies had the least amount of in person jobs and mainly offered remote work.
Surprisingly, medium sized companies had the highest amount of in person jobs and very little hybrid work offered. 
Large companies had the most variance with mainly in person work, a high amount of remote work, and hybrid options. 


## üå± Salary Distribution by Experience Level

This boxplot shows the salary distribution by experience level.
The whiskers are the minimum and maximum values. The line within the box is the median and the box itself shows the lower quartile and upper quartile ranges. Anything plotted outside of the whiskers are outliers. 
As I expected, entry level jobs typically tend to be the lowest paid, followed by mid-level, senior level, and executive level. There are the most outliers with mid-level and senior level jobs. 

## ü§ì Data Cleaning Process
This dataset contained information about companies that were not located in the U.S. For the purpose of my analysis, I excluded those and only focused on U.S. based companies. 
This dataset also contained information about multiple types of employees. I removed all data that was not related to full time employees. 

## üìÖ Future Goals
- Explore pay based on type: contracting, part-time, freelance
- Compare hybrid, in person, and remote salaries
- U.S. average pay compared to other countries
