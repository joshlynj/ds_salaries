## 🤓 Data Cleaning Process
This dataset contained information about companies that were not located in the U.S. For the purpose of my analysis, I excluded those and only focused on U.S. based companies. 
This dataset also contained information about multiple types of employees. I removed all data that was not related to full time employees.
